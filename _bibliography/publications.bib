abstract = {Many diseases and complex traits exhibit population-specific causal effect sizes with trans-ethnic genetic correlations significantly less than 1, limiting trans-ethnic polygenic risk prediction. We developed a new method, S-LDXR, for stratifying squared trans-ethnic genetic correlation across genomic annotations, and applied S-LDXR to genome-wide association summary statistics for 30 diseases and complex traits in East Asians (EAS) and Europeans (EUR) (average N=93K for EAS, N=274K for EUR) with an average trans-ethnic genetic correlation of 0.83 (s.e. 0.01). We determined that squared trans-ethnic genetic correlation was 0.81× (s.e. 0.01) smaller than the genome-wide average at SNPs in the top quintile of background selection statistic, implying more population-specific causal effect sizes. Accordingly, causal effect sizes were more population-specific in functionally important regions, including coding, conserved, and regulatory regions. In analyses of regions surrounding specifically expressed genes, causal effect sizes were most population-specific for skin and immune genes and least population-specific for brain genes. Our results could potentially be explained by stronger gene-environment interaction at loci impacted by selection, particularly positive selection.},

@article{Horikoshi2018,
abstract = {Population studies over the past decade have successfully elucidated the genetic architecture of reproductive ageing. However, those studies were largely limited to European ancestries, restricting the generalizability of the findings and overlooking possible key genes poorly captured by common European genetic variation. Here, in up to 67,029 women of Japanese ancestry, we report 26 loci (all P{\textless}5x10-8) for puberty timing or age at menopause, representing the first loci for reproductive ageing in any non-European population. Highlighted genes for menopause include GNRH1, which supports a primary, rather than passive, role for hypothalamic-pituitary GnRH signalling in the timing of menopause. For puberty timing, we demonstrate an aetiological role for receptor-like protein tyrosine phosphatases by combining evidence across population genetics and pre- and peri-pubertal changes in hypothalamic gene expression in rodent and primate models. Furthermore, our findings demonstrate widespread differences in allele frequencies and effect estimates between Japanese and European populations, highlighting the benefits and challenges of large-scale trans-ethnic approaches.},
